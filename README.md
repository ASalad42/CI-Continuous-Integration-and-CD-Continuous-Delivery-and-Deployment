# CI CD Pipeline

**CI CD is considered as the backbone of DevOps practices and automation**, It plays vital, challenging and exciting role in DevOps culture, growing numbers of companies releasing software in minutes with the adoption of CICD practices.

To put it simply, the continuous integration is part of both continuous delivery and continuous deployment. The main difference is the deployment step, in **continuous delivery the deployment is done manually** and in **continuous deployment it happens automatically**

## Continuous Integration (CI)
Developers merge/commit code to master branch multiple times a day, fully automated build and test process which gives feedback within few minutes, by doing so, you avoid the integration hell that usually happens when people wait for release day to merge their changes into the release branch.

## Continuous Delivery
Continuous Delivery ensures that you can release new changes to your customers quickly in a sustainable way. This means that on top of having automated your testing, you also have automated your release process and you can deploy your application at any point of time by clicking on a button. **In continuous Delivery the deployment is completed manually.**


## Continuous Deployment 
Continuous Deployment goes one step further than continuous delivery, with this practice, **every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers, there is no human intervention**, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production.

## Jenkins 

Jenkins is an open-source automation server in which the central build and CI process take place, It is a Java-based program with packages for Windows, macOS, & Linux.


## Webhook 
In gh webhook (any new change frm local host will trigger webhook) (sns need to inform somone â€“ job of webhook)



## SSH Github 
To production env via ssh (hhtp not secure)



## SSH Github to Jenkins 


## SSH-AWS-keys from Jenkins to AWS
